# Game Card

## Description

A credit card sized portable game console utilizing buttons, multiple games, and an i2c display

## Version 1

Version 1 was designed for an Arduino and is essentially complete, though I never got the PCB working.

I've now moved to version 2 which utilizes the Raspberry Pi Pico, a $4 microcontroller that greatly overpowers my $2 ATmega328p

## Building

Run `make`
