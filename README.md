## Improving the Design (HELP!)

Right now I'm trying to redesign a new version where I can source all the electronics from manufacturers for a few reasons including:
 * Putting them up for sale
 * Decreasing cost
 * Simplifying build time

I've got everything redesigned and sourced except for the display. These little OLEDs are available everywhere except distributers it seems, and while they're like \$1-3 usually, I can't find sourcable ones for PCBs under \$10.

When the rest of the electronics costs \$4 total, it seems insane for it to be almost $15 to make.

If you can find a source I can use to build this, PLEASE let me know!

## Game List

Currently there are three games developed for the Game Card:

- Ping (1 and 2 player pong clone)
- Snek (Snake clone)
- In Progress: Tiny RPG (a very small RPG)
